# Sample haproxy configuration for keyservers
(c) Martin Dobrev, Andrew Gallagher 2023

Supply this directory to `haproxy` using the `-f DIRECTORY` command-line option.
The files in this directory are optimised for hockeypuck's `docker-compose/standalone` deployment.

You MUST copy the two `*LOCAL*.cfg.tmpl` files to the corresponding `*LOCAL*.cfg` file before use.
Hockeypuck's `contrib/docker-compose/standalone/mkconfig.bash` script will do this automatically.
(see `contrib/docker-compose/standalone/README.md` for full instructions)
This allows you to edit the `*LOCAL*.cfg` files without introducing git merge conflicts.

To facilitate portability, these files have been parameterised using envar substitution, i.e. "${...}"
You can populate these values at runtime by setting the corresponding environment variables:

* FQDN                  the FQDN of this server, note that aliases must also be configured
* CERTBOT_HOST_PORT     backend for ACME requests, in the form `host:port`
* PROMETHEUS_HOST_PORT  backend for prometheus monitoring, in the form `host:port`
* KEYSERVER_HOST_PORT   backend for the keyserver, in the form `host:port`
* HAP_CONF_DIR          location of config files
                        normally `/etc/haproxy` for baremetal, `/usr/local/etc/haproxy` for docker
                        it must have a subdir `lists` containing `blacklist.list` and `whitelist.list` (can be empty files)
* HAP_CACHE_DIR         persistent state store, must contain `tor_exit_relays.list` (refreshed externally)
* HAP_CERT_DIR          parent directory of SSL/TLS certificate directory
                        it must contain a subdirectory named after the FQDN, itself containing `fullchain.pem` and `fullchain.pem.key`
                        e.g. for letsencrypt this will be `/etc/letsencrypt/live`
* HAP_DHPARAM_FILE      Diffie-Hellman parameters for SSL/TLS

These envars are normally supplied by `contrib/docker-compose/standalone/docker-compose.yml`.

Note that after the cache files or the SSL certs are updated externally, haproxy should be soft reloaded by sending it a HUP signal.
